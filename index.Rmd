## Agenda

* Why `tidyverse`? Tidy data


* What does `gg` in `ggplot2` stand for? Grammar of graphics


* Interactive data visualisation on the web
    + plotly: `ggplotly()`, `plot_ly`, animation
    + shiny app: `wanderer4melb`

???

Lemme introduce myself a little bit. I'm currently doing my PhD at Monash, working
with Di and Rob. My research is about visualising temporal data.

This is what I'm going to cover for the next one hour and half. First, I'll talk
about why `tidyverse` is great. `tidyverse` is a collection of R packages that
center around the "tidy data" concept. We'll learn some verbs/functions that do 
the data wrangling to get the tidy temporal data. As data analysts ... Second, we'll learn about the 
`ggplot2` that handles with plotting. You may wonder why it's called `ggplot2` 
and what `gg` means. It's grammar of graphics for plots. I'll talk about how the
`ggplot2` functions powered by the grammar help us to visualise time series data.
In the final bit, I'm going to show you some demos about interactive graphics using
`plotly` and `shiny`.

## R packages

* `tidyverse`: a collection of R packages surrounding "tidy data"
* `stringr`: handle string manipulation
* `forcats`: handle categorical variables
* `lubridate`: lubricate date-times process
* `plotly`: create web-based visualisation
* `shiny`: build interactive web applications
* `knitr`: provide tools for dynamic report generation
* `devtools`: help with R packages development

```{r load-library}
```

```{r theme-remark}
```

???

Here's a list of R packages that we're going to use for this part. As I said
before, `tidyverse` is a set of packages including `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `readr`
etc. `stringr` for strings and `forcats` for categorical variables. `lubridate`
is for making dealing with dates easier. `plotly` and `shiny` for interactive
graphics on the web.

# Tidy data

???

Okay. Now, let's start with tidy data.

---

class: middle

## What is tidy data?

* Each variable forms a column.
* Each observation forms a row.
* Each type of observational unit forms a table.

???

What is tidy data? What makes a dataset tidy?

1.2.3

The data structure is a rectangular cases-by-variables data layout that underlines
the `tidyverse`.

I'll use three datasets to explain what tidy data actually mean. How important
is the tidy data for further data analysis and vis.

```{r ped-loc, echo = TRUE}
```

.footnote[.red[*] source: [the city of Melbourne](http://www.pedestrian.melbourne.vic.gov.au)]
]

???

The first dataset we're going to look at is ...

The dataset is sourced from Melbourne Open Data Portal. You can actually click
here to check out the web page that hosts the dataset. Since 2009, the city of
Melb started to install some sensors that capture the foot traffic every hour.
This data can be used for urban planning or business management. For example,
if you're a cafe owner, by looking at the hourly traffic to decide the trading
hours. Until today, there are 43 sensors have been installed across the city.

Here, I read the sensor locations data into R using `read_csv` from `readr` pkg.
Rob has talked about the pipe operator. I pass the data to the `select` function
and select four colnames, that is ...

.left-column[
## Melbourne pedestrian data `r emo::ji("walking_woman")`
### - sensor data
### - sensor map
]
.right-column[

```{r ped-map, dev = "CairoPNG", dpi = 300}
```
]

???

As I know sensor's long and lat, I could plot these sensors on the map of Melb.
It clearly shows the locations of these sensors.

.left-column[
## Melbourne pedestrian data `r emo::ji("walking_woman")`
### - sensor data
### - sensor map
### - hourly counts
]
.right-column[

```{r ped-wide, echo = TRUE}
```
]

???

Besides the locations, we're more interested in learning about the hourly pedestrian
counts at every sensor. I read the second csv file that contains the pedestrian
counts in March.

For this data, there are 744 obs and 45 columns. ...

Date is read into as character ...

Lemme me refer to this kind of format as wide format by contrast to long form.
I'll explain what I mean by wide and long later.

.left-column[
## Melbourne pedestrian data `r emo::ji("walking_woman")`

]
.right-column[
]

???

The remedy is converting the wide format to the long data.

The top data table is what we have, wide

gather the headers to one key variable, and the counts to the value variable.

By having more than 40 columns, we have four vars to work with. Looking at this
long form, what are the variables become clearer compared to the wide format.
Each variable forms a column.

from tidyr

organise the same data in two different ways. To be consistent, tidy long data used.

# Grammar of graphics

???

* basic/good understanding of tidy data structure
* bc it builds a solid foundation to statistical vis.

---

class: middle

## What is grammar of graphics?

* In 1999, "The grammar of graphics" by Leland Wilkinson
* In 2008, `ggplot2` by Hadley Wickham
* A conceptual framework for mapping variables to graphical elements
* The analogue of doing a functional mapping of random variables. For example,
  $n$ independent and identically distributed RVs $X_1, \ldots, X_n$, the mean and
  the standard deviation are defined as 
  $$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} X_{i} \qquad S_{n-1} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \left(X_i - \bar{X} \right)^2.$$

???

we're going to use some short but comprehensive vocabulary to describe different
sorts of graphs.

grammar remains the same but using transformed data

I've just showed you how to use the graphics to explore the data. Notice something
unexpected and use your expertise or other resources to explain and produce another
graph.

Has anyone noticed there's another weired day that I haven't explained/exploited?

known as rose plot

This slide also shows the advantage of using the grammar. Instead of referring
to these as line and rose, the grammar informs you of the difference between
the two plots is simply one linear and one polar coordinates.

polar: periodic behaviour

When you need to decide which plot you should pick up for you presentation, it
should be conducted under the statistical hypothesis testing framework, known
as visual inference. 

Be aware of that it provides scientific tools to help with which display is more
powerful.

  too? like temperature and rainfall? If it's extremely cold and heavy rain/storm,
  would you hand out in the city?

`sugrrants` `r emo::ji("ant")` is an R package (under development) that supports 
graphics for analysing time series data.

```r
devtools::install_github("earowang/sugrrants")
library(sugrrants)

* It fits into the tidyverse and grammar of graphics suite of methods for exploring
  temporal data.
* Calendar-based graphics are useful for visualising people's daily schedules, and
  `frame_calendar` `r emo::ji("spiral_calendar")` is made available for this.

If you find a bug or wanna suggest a new feature, please report/propose it on 
the [Github page](https://github.com/earowang/sugrrants/issues). Thanks.
